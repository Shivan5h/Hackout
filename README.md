## Problem :-Sustainable Farming through AI: Optimizing Crop Choices and Market Success
Harness AI to empower farmers with data-driven decisions, ensuring better crop yields and market alignment.  Transform traditional farming into a modern, efficient practice, promoting environmental sustainability and economic growth.  Enable farmers to thrive by providing insights from planting to market, fostering a resilient agricultural ecosystem.
## Our Idea :-
1. Empowers farmers with market-based intelligence and optimized farming practices.
2. Analyzes market demand to offer tailored crop recommendations with demand scores.
3. Farmers input crop preferences, location, land size, previous crops, and soil details.
4. Implements crop rotation models and assesses soil health.
5. Provides actionable insights for maximum yield and sustainability.
6. A one-stop solution guiding farmers from planting to selling, aligning efforts with market trends.
